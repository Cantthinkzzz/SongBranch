For lonely girls, it's always the same, dreaming dreams that don't come true
And churning, churning through the clamor in their heads

A lonely girl mutters "I'm fine", have words failed her?
A failure, a failure.
Obsessing over her mistakes makes everything spin again!

One more time, one more time
"I'll roll along again today"
The girl said, the girl said
Breathing life into the words!
